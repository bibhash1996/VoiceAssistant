ðŸš€ Conversational AI Portfolio Project!

ðŸ“ž You can now call a number and speak directly with an AI Agent â€” in real time.
 This isnâ€™t just audio-to-audio playback. It's a fully contextual voice interaction, where the AI listens, thinks, and responds based on everything it knows about me.
ðŸŽ¯ A few highlights:
âœ… Real-time two-way audio powered by Twilio Voice + OpenAI's streaming API
âœ… Dynamic context handling â€” responses are accurate, personalized, and conversational
âœ… Feels much more like talking to a real person than a scripted bot

ðŸŽ¥ Demo attached!
This is a proof of concept (POC) for now, but it opens up exciting possibilities in real-time, voice-driven AI experiences â€” from personal assistants to customer support and beyond.
Would love to hear your thoughts â€” and if youâ€™ve explored similar ideas or want to jam on this space, letâ€™s connect!
